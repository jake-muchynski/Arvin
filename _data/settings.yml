  - {name: 'Mr.Blair Ward', title: 'Pollard Windows Inc', quote: '<p>Arvin Air Systems was retained to perform an energy conservation audit of our plant area. Arvin Air identified the energy savings opportunities and guaranteed a three-year payback on the project. Arvin Air implemented an energy conservation plan, which included installing a temperature setback system for the natural gas unit heaters and steam fan coils in the plant. The work performed was a turnkey contract that was completed on schedule. The benefits to us were, reduced operating costs, state of the art control system and improved comfort for our employees. Arvin Air guaranteed the energy savings and the simple payback for the project will be two years instead of three. Our only regret is we did not implement this energy control system sooner than now!
